# RpanList
https://i.redd.it/24dj08c9dai31.png

Lists current RPAN streams, and lets you download them or watch them on your browser.

Downloading requires [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/). Extract it somewhere, open RpanList, and locate its path from the Settings panel.

## Planned features ~~that will never get added because RPAN is over~~
- Added: ~~A proper Settings window that lets you change the path of youtube-dl, your download directory, download quality, etc
- A search bar
- Opening the stream in a media player like VLC
- Periodic refreshing (every x seconds)
- A connection indicator that also displays errors, instead of a message box
- Inline video player, similar to Redesign's Classic mode
