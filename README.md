**Note: RPAN [has ended](https://www.reddit.com/r/pan/comments/cum45p/good_night_rpan/), so this project is completely useless as of now.**

# RpanList
https://i.redd.it/24dj08c9dai31.png
Lists current RPAN streams, and lets you download them or watch them on your browser.

Downloading requires [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) - the path is currently hardcoded, and expects youtube-dl.exe to be in C:\\. Ability to change the path will be added in the near future.

## Planned features that will never get added because RPAN is over
- A proper Settings window that lets you change the path of youtube-dl, your download directory, download quality, etc
- Opening the stream in a media player like VLC
- Inline video player, similar to Redesign's Classic mode
- A search bar
- A connection indicator that also displays errors, instead of a message box
- Periodic refreshing (every x seconds)
