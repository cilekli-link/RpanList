# RpanList

Lists current RPAN streams, and lets you download them or watch them on your browser.

Downloading requires [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Extract both of them in the same directory, open RpanList, and set youtube-dl's path from the Settings panel.

## Planned features
- Opening the stream in a media player like VLC
- Inline video player, similar to Redesign's Classic mode
- **Added:** ~~A proper Settings window that lets you change the path of youtube-dl, your download directory, download quality, etc~~
- **Added:** ~~A search bar~~
- **Added:** ~~Periodic refreshing (every x seconds)~~
