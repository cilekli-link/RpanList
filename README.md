# RpanList
![A screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilekli-link/RpanList/master/screenshot.png)

Lists current RPAN streams, and lets you download them or watch them on your browser.

Downloading requires [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Extract it somewhere, open RpanList, and set its path from the Settings panel.

## Planned features
- A "DVR" that automatically records streams from a user, or streams that match a specific search filter 
- Desktop notifications (when RPAN is back, when a user starts streaming, when a download has ended, etc)
- Opening the stream in a media player like VLC
- Inline video player, similar to Redesign's Classic mode
